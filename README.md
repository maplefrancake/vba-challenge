## Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 2 Challenge

## Description
This project challenges us to create a script that loops through all the stocks between 2018 and 2020 (one sheet per year) and outputs a variety of information to be analyzed later on. The instructions for this challenge can be found on our [Canvas](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2866/assignments/45778?module_item_id=845302). I've included both a txt and bas file that includes the VBA code I wrote to produce the information mentioned previously. Additionally, I've included three screenshots of the first few rows of each sheet in the final workbook.
