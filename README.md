## Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 2 Challenge

## Description
This project challenges us to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs a variety of information to be analyzed later on. The instructions for this challenge can be found on our [Canvas](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2866/assignments/45778?module_item_id=845302)

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
